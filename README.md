## 💡 Abstract
Weakly supervised 3D point cloud semantic segmentation (WS3DSS) under extreme sparsity (e.g., 0.1% labels) constitutes a severely ill-posed learning problem. To address the absence of multi-level consistency regularization, we propose **GTC-Seg**, a unified framework that enforces:
1. **Geometric Structural Consistency (LEAP):** Preserves high-frequency topological details before spatial downsampling via explicit relative position encoding.
2. **Cross-Modal Semantic Consistency (CGCM):** Safely injects 2D foundation model (MaskCLIP) priors into 3D feature space through a category-aware rejection gate.
3. **Temporal Prediction Consistency (PLR):** Blocks error accumulation using a dual-scale temporal memory bank and dynamic thresholding.

## 📈 Main Results (Preview)
Under **0.1%** extremely sparse supervision, GTC-Seg effectively overcomes geometric over-smoothing and semantic ambiguity, achieving State-of-the-Art performance:
- **S3DIS (Area 5):** `65.6%` mIoU
- **ScanNet V2:** `65.3%` mIoU (Val) / `65.1%` mIoU (Test)
- **SemanticKITTI:** `53.4%` mIoU

## 🛠️ Codebase Structure (Coming Soon)
The upcoming code release will include:
- [ ] Training and evaluation scripts for S3DIS, ScanNet V2, SemanticKITTI, LiDAR-Net, and STPLS3D.
- [ ] Implementations of the LEAP, CGCM, and PLR modules.
- [ ] Pre-trained weights for quick reproduction.
- [ ] Detailed data preprocessing guidelines.
